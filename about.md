Hi! Welcome to Chi's math corner.

I am Chi Tong, a Math and Computer Science undergraduate at Yale. I am interested in theoretical computer science research such as graph problems, algorithm optimization, linear programming, network science.

This blog will focus on my research interests, such as some topics I explored during the summer at New Haven: Subcubic equivalences of graph and Quantum Computing, and (maybe) my senior project. 

You can contact me at hienchi19 [at] gmail [dot] com.
